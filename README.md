# Simon Game

This project is a web-based version of the classic Simon game. Players are challenged to memorize and replicate a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game.

## Getting Started

To start playing the Simon game, follow these instructions:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Press any key to begin the game.
4. Observe and listen as the game presents a sequence of colors.
5. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
6. If you make an error, the game will end and display a "Game Over" message.
7. Press any key to restart and play again.

## How It Works

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **HTML (index.html):** Defines the structure of the game interface, including the color buttons and level title.
- **CSS (styles.css):** Styles the game interface with colors, layout, and animations.
- **JavaScript (game.js):** Implements the game logic, handling user input, generating random sequences, playing sounds, and verifying if the user’s input matches the generated sequence. The game also uses jQuery for easier manipulation of the DOM and handling events.

## Customization

You can modify and enhance the game by making the following changes:

- **Adding More Colors:** Update the `buttonColours` array in `game.js` to include new colors. Ensure corresponding CSS classes are defined in `styles.css`.
- **Changing Difficulty:** Adjust the game’s difficulty by modifying its behavior, such as altering the speed at which colors are presented or increasing the length of sequences.
- **Visual Modifications:** Customize the game’s appearance by editing the CSS styles in `styles.css`. Experiment with different colors, animations, and layouts to match your preferences.

## What I Learned

Creating this Simon game provided me with valuable experience in:

- **JavaScript and jQuery:** Manipulating the game interface, handling user inputs, generating random sequences, and implementing game logic.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating HTML elements, such as changing the level title or animating button presses.
- **Event Handling:** Listening for user events (keypresses and button clicks) and triggering appropriate actions.
- **CSS Styling:** Styling the game interface, including colors, borders, animations, and transitions.
- **Array Manipulation:** Using arrays to store and manage game patterns, and comparing user input with the generated sequence.
- **Game Development Principles:** Understanding fundamental concepts like generating random sequences, checking user input, and implementing game over and restart functionality.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements to the game could include:

- **High Scores:** Implement a system to track and display players' high scores.
- **Timed Mode:** Add a mode where players must complete each level within a specific time limit.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Enable multiplayer functionality for competitive gameplay.
- **Sound Options:** Allow players to adjust sound settings or add different sound effects for each color.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Optimize the game for mobile devices and touchscreen interactions.
